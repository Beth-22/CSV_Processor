**POST** `/upload`

### Request:

* `multipart/form-data`
* Field: `file` (.csv)

### 📊 Response (200 OK):

```json
{
  "message": "File processed successfully",
  "departments": 2,
  "processingTimeMs": 6,
  "fileSizeKB": 0,
  "processedFileName": "sample-input-processed.csv",
  "downloadUrl": "/results/sample-input-processed.csv"
}
```

#### Field Descriptions:

| Field               | Description                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `message`           | Status message                 |
| `departments`       | Count of unique departments    |
| `processingTimeMs`  | Time taken to process the file |
| `fileSizeKB`        | Size of uploaded file          |
| `processedFileName` | Output filename                |
| `downloadUrl`       | URL to download processed CSV  |

##  Algorithm & Performance Strategy

### Problem:

Aggregate total sales by department from a CSV file with this structure:

```
Department Name,Date,Number of Sales
New York,2023-01-01,100
Boston,2023-01-01,50
```

### Solution Strategy:

* Stream CSV file line-by-line using `csv-parser` + `fs.createReadStream`
* Skip rows with missing or invalid data
* Use a `Record<string, number>` map to accumulate totals

### Memory Efficiency:

✅ Uses **streaming** — avoids loading the entire file in memory
✅ Supports large files that can't fit in RAM

---

## 📈 Big O Complexity

| Operation                    | Complexity   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| Reading file (streamed)      | O(n)         |
| Aggregation (map insert/acc) | O(1) per row |
| Total                        | **O(n)**     |

---

##  File Type Validation

* Accepts only `.csv` files
* Rejects other MIME types via `multer`
